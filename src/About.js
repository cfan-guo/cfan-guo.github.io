      <p className="about__long">
        I graduated with a Bachelors of Applied Sciences in Computer Engineering from the University of
        Toronto. During my time there, I was active in many areas of student life: from outreach and dance
        to sports and <a href="http://skulepedia.ca/wiki/Welcome">Skule spirit</a>. I was a residence don
        in my last year at <a href="http://www.newcollege.utoronto.ca/"> New College Residence</a>, and directly
        responsible for the wellbeing of the 40 students on my floor.

      <p className="about__long">
        I love being on diverse teams, learning from smart people and being involved in company stuff
        outside of my direct responsibilities. In the past, I've helped out with university recruitment and
        interviewing, and I've given and facilitated talks at company roundtables and technical microlearns.
      </p>
      <p className="about__long">
        In my spare time, I like to read about new technologies, cook, and work out in my home gym. I also love
        to travel. My favourite is exploring different markets and trying new foods!
